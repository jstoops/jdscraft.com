              <p>
                I supported Videomaker by providing a reliable technical
                infrastructure and overseeing development efforts for their
                website, mobile apps, third-party integrations, and internal
                tools. It was a leadership role that required innovative
                thinking that coupled business strategy with technical
                opportunity. It was also a highly enjoyable hands-on agile team
                lead role using PHP, and Drupal 7 to improve the videographer's
                training portal which interacted with OpenX, Recurly, Vimeo and
                Quickfill, web services for iPad app that I published updates to
                Apple’s iStore, GIT and used Selenium IDE for testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I started the website was frequently going down and we were
                losing a lot of online revenue due to visitors not being able to
                access the site, watch training videos or become
                members/subscribers at these times of outage, not to mention
                lost ad revenue. I identified the root causes of the problem
                which was the hosting platform currently in use and a tightly
                coupled set of systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                After performing a thorough hosting vendor product comparison
                and benefits analysis I secured the budget to move the website
                to Acquia’s cloud-based hosting service, setup and configured
                Memcached for publicly accessible web pages and started
                monitoring the site’s performance with New Relic to identify
                bottlenecks and memory leaks. With the help of the small
                development team, we decoupled the ad server from the site and
                moved it onto a separate and more cost-effective hosting
                environment. I chose Bluehost’s VPS hosting package for the
                OpenX ad server we were self-hosting, although I would have
                preferred using their hosted ad server instead but could not
                secure the budget for that at the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The site had a 100% uptime after the transition to the new
                hosting platform and decoupling the systems, the page load
                speeds improved significantly by using page caching which
                increased customer satisfaction. This helped the marketing team
                achieve higher rankings on the search engines as well as having
                the confidence to drive even more traffic to the site because it
                could now handle it with ease by automatically adjusting the
                hardware allocated to it, increasing the ROI on the site for the
                organization.

                My main responsibility was to gather requirements from clients
                and identify how the system being developed fits into the
                overall business processes in onsite Joint Application Design
                (JAD) sessions. I’d then analyze and document the requirements
                in a formal System Requirements Specification (SRS) meeting
                company quality standards and present it, along with creating
                the HTML mockups of the UI, to the client for sign-off with the
                project manager. I would then work with the developers and DBAs
                to estimate the development effort by breaking down the
                functionality into small tasks/estimating elements for the
                project managers to update their project plans and schedules
                with more accurate estimates to ensure the projects were on
                track and within budget.

                In the next phase, I would work with the developers and DBAs to
                design the software, apply appropriate design patterns and
                consider the various architectural viewpoints of the system that
                I then documented using UML diagrams and entity-relationship
                diagrams (ERDs) for DBAs, where appropriate. At the same time,
                I’d work on the test plan, starting with the test cases
                identified from the use case scenarios and documenting unit,
                integration, vulnerability and performance tests planned by the
                development team, or mandated by the client in the requirements
                or constraints.

                progress to the client, the project manager and other key
                project stakeholders, mentoring junior analysts, leading the
                development on .NET projects and training the users how to use
                the new system once installed onsite. I ensured the software
                complied with and met all client requirements and quality
                metrics by demonstrating full traceability through to
                implemented code, services, APIs, scripts, screens, documents,

                user acceptance test (UAT) sessions, creating the documents
                detailing each release of the software to various parties for

                  incomplete, or inaccurate service set up. Automated ISP
