                services and requires negotiation and coordination across many

              <p>
                Upon starting I worked with other managers and developers to start a
                grassroots effort to use agile development practices (XP, Lean, iterative
                Unified Process, Scrum), CI/CD, and automated tests. I worked with senior
                developers and IT managers to document these coding and quality standards
                to bring benefits to the rest of the organization.

                  <b>Payments Team:</b> Within the first couple of months had turned the
                  Payment team around from fixing bugs 90% of the time to just working on
                  new features by refactoring all the code to achieve 100+% unit test
                  coverage to detect regression issues with any changes made before
                  releasing them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>PCI Project:</b> When the organization needed to comply with PCI
                  regulations, I was chosen to lead the AWS Cardholder Data Environment
                  (CDE) project that was completed within a tight deadline and has proven
                  to be a highly reliable, secure, robust payment processing system.

                <li>
                  <b>Mobile App Beachhead Project:</b> Joint lead for the team developing
                  the foundation for the HA Hub to meet the organization's IT strategic
                  goals, prove out the enterprise architecture, and lay the foundation for
                  Data & Common Services to transform HA's aging IT infrastructure and
                  outdated software development practices using modern technology and design
                  principles. MVP features included SSCI, shopping, flight status,
                  enterprise service bus (ESB) messaging platform, and push notifications.
