              <p>
                I supported Videomaker by providing a reliable technical infrastructure and
                overseeing development efforts for their website, mobile apps, third-party
                integrations, and internal tools. It was a leadership role that required innovative
                thinking that coupled business strategy with technical opportunity. It was also a
                highly enjoyable hands-on agile team lead role using PHP, and Drupal 7 to improve
                the videographer's training portal which interacted with OpenX, Recurly, Vimeo and
                Quickfill, web services for iPad app that I published updates to Apple’s iStore,
                GIT and used Selenium IDE for testing.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I started the website was frequently going down and we were losing a lot of
                online revenue due to visitors not being able to access the site, watch training
                videos or become members/subscribers at these times of outage, not to mention lost
                ad revenue. I identified the root causes of the problem which was the hosting
                platform currently in use and a tightly coupled set of systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                After performing a thorough hosting vendor product comparison and benefits analysis
                I secured the budget to move the website to Acquia’s cloud-based hosting service,
                setup and configured Memcached for publicly accessible web pages and started
                monitoring the site’s performance with New Relic to identify bottlenecks and memory
                leaks. With the help of the small development team, we decoupled the ad server from
                the site and moved it onto a separate and more cost-effective hosting environment.
                I chose Bluehost’s VPS hosting package for the OpenX ad server we were self-hosting,
                although I would have preferred using their hosted ad server instead but could not
                secure the budget for that at the time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The site had a 100% uptime after the transition to the new hosting platform and
                decoupling the systems, the page load speeds improved significantly by using page
                caching which increased customer satisfaction. This helped the marketing team achieve
                higher rankings on the search engines as well as having the confidence to drive even
                more traffic to the site because it could now handle it with ease by automatically
                adjusting the hardware allocated to it, increasing the ROI on the site for the
                organization.
