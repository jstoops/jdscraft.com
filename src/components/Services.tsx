          <p>
            I have experience transforming businesses with IT and integrating AI
            to streamline business processes and autonomously execute tasks on
            the users behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is achieved by selecting technology that aligns with the
            business and IT strategy. Once a AI adoption plan is in place I then
            applying good engineering practices to developing, fine-tuning,
            rigorously testing, and either deploying specially trained
            open-source large language models (LLMs) to the cloud or safely
            utilizing frontier LLMs safely using best practices in software
            engineering design principles and coding practices. This delivers
            accurate and actionable insights for the business and the users on a
            robust, scalable, secure and reliable platform.
