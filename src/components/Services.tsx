          <p>
            I have experience building and optimizing multiple AI agent
            frameworks to streamline business processes and autonomously execute
            tasks on the users behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is achieved by developing, fine-tuning, rigorously testing, and
            deploying large language models (LLMs) to the cloud using best
            practices in software engineering design principles and coding
            practices. This delivers accurate and actionable insights for the
            business and the users on a robust, scalable, secure and reliable
            platform.
