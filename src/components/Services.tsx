            I have experience transforming businesses with IT and integrating AI
            to streamline business processes and autonomously execute tasks on
            the users behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is achieved by selecting technology that aligns with the
            business and IT strategy. Once a AI adoption plan is in place I then
            applying good engineering practices to developing, fine-tuning,
            rigorously testing, and either deploying specially trained
            open-source large language models (LLMs) to the cloud or safely
            utilizing frontier LLMs using best practices in software engineering
            design, security, data privacy and coding principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            This delivers accurate and actionable insights for the business and
            the users on a robust, scalable, secure and reliable platform.
