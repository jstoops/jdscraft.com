          Apart from being an IT nerd, I enjoy running and playing TTRPGs with
          my friends, terrain building and miniature painting for TTRPGs, 3D
          printing, playing computer games, modding computer games, playing
          board games, and cycling trails.

          When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre
          movies and television shows, I am an aspiring blogger, and I spend a
          large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology
          advancements in the data and software development world.
